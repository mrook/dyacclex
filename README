    What:
    
    Delphi Yacc & Lex is a parser generator toolset for Delphi and Kylix,
    based on Turbo Pascal Lex and Yacc, version 4.1, by Albert Graef et al.
    The primary goal is to clean up the code, and improve compatibility
    and maintainability.
    
    Why:
    
    The project started because the original Turbo Pascal Lex and Yacc 
    did not compile well in Delphi 5+ or Kylix, the sourcecode was messy, 
    and the last release or activity dates back to early 2000.
    
    Changes:
    
    * Relicensed the following files under the LGPL:
        - dlib.pas
        - lexlib.pas
        - yacclib.pas
        
      Note: this was done to eliminate any confusion regarding the use of 
      generated parsers and the above support files in propietary software.
      The files lexlib.pas and yacclib.pas were present in dyacclex's
      predecessor, TPLY 4.1, without a license.
    
    * Added PDF manual based on original TPLY 4.1 manual.
       
    Compilation:
    
    Compiling DYACCLEX is pretty straightforward, you only need the 
    following ingredients:
    
    	Linux:
    		Borland Kylix 3
    		GNU make (usually pre-installed on your system)
    		
    	Windows:
    		Borland Delphi 6 or higher
    		GNU make (available from
                http://www.grendelproject.nl/dls/gnumake-win32.zip)
    		
    
    If these ingredients are present, you then enter 'make'.
    When the process terminates succesfully, you can find executables in 
    the 'src/lex' and 'src/yacc' directories.
        
    Installation:
    
    If you want to move the binaries (dyacc.exe and dlex.exe on a Windows 
    machine, dyacc and dlex on a Linux machine), make sure you 
    copy yylex.cod and yyparse.cod along with them.
    
    All files generated by dyacc need yacclib.pas, and all files generated 
    by dlex need lexlib.pas. Both units can be found in the 'src' directory.
